# ‚úÖ FINAL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## üéØ Professional Image Added Successfully!

Your actual professional photo is now integrated into the hero section and looks fantastic!

## üö® CRITICAL: Remove Duplicate Workflow

You still have a duplicate workflow file that MUST be deleted before deployment:

```
‚ùå /workflows/deploy.yml (DELETE THIS ENTIRE FOLDER)
‚úÖ /.github/workflows/deploy.yml (Keep this one)
```

### Delete Command:
```bash
rm -rf workflows/
```

## üìã Complete Deployment Steps

### 1. Clean Up Duplicate Files
```bash
# Delete duplicate workflow folder
rm -rf workflows/

# Remove unnecessary documentation files (optional)
rm -rf BUILD_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md CRITICAL_BUILD_FIXES.md DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_CHECK.md FINAL_BUILD_SOLUTION.md FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md GITHUB_PAGES_TROUBLESHOOTING.md QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md
```

### 2. For GitHub Pages - Image Fix
Since `figma:asset` won't work on GitHub Pages, you'll need to:

**Option A: Public Folder (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create public directory and add your photo
mkdir -p public
# Copy your professional photo to public/profile.jpg
```

Then update `/components/HeroSection.tsx`:
```tsx
// Replace line 3:
// import profileImage from 'figma:asset/5fdc4c369ac80a2162d863fc63195ab73343fce3.png';

// With:
const profileImage = '/profile.jpg';
```

**Option B: Keep Current for Figma Make Only**
If you want to keep the current setup, your portfolio will work perfectly in Figma Make but may have image loading issues on GitHub Pages.

### 3. Final Commit and Deploy
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add professional photo and finalize portfolio"

# Push to deploy
git push
```
