# 🎯 FINAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Remove Duplicate Workflow

You currently have TWO workflow files:
- ✅ `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (CORRECT - keep this)
- ❌ `/workflows/deploy.yml` (WRONG - must delete)

**This duplicate can cause deployment conflicts!**

## 🔧 Required Actions

### 1. Delete Duplicate Workflow (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Delete the entire workflows folder in root
rm -rf workflows/
```
OR manually delete the `/workflows` folder from your project.

### 2. Verify Your Configuration
Your current setup shows:
- GitHub username: `chiranjeevi-ak`
- Repository name: `portfolio`
- Live URL will be: `https://chiranjeevi-ak.github.io/portfolio`

**⚠️ Important:** These MUST match your actual GitHub repository exactly!

### 3. If Repository Name is Different
If your actual repository name is NOT "portfolio", update these files:

**vite.config.js (line 7):**
```javascript
base: '/your-actual-repo-name/',
```

**package.json (line 28):**
```json
"homepage": "https://chiranjeevi-ak.github.io/your-actual-repo-name"
```

**index.html (line 13):**
```html
<meta property="og:url" content="https://chiranjeevi-ak.github.io/your-actual-repo-name/" />
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clean Up
```bash
# Remove duplicate workflow
rm -rf workflows/

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Remove duplicate workflow file"

# Push
git push
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** in left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Save

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow run starting
3. Wait for green checkmark ✅ (takes 2-3 minutes)
4. Visit your live URL

## ✅ Success Indicators

When deployment succeeds:
- Actions tab shows green checkmark ✅
- Your portfolio loads at the GitHub Pages URL
- All sections are visible and functional
- Navigation works smoothly
- Images load correctly
- Mobile responsive design works

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Doesn't Run
- Ensure repository is public
