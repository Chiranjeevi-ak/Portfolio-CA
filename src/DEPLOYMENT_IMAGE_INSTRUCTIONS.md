# ðŸ“¸ Professional Image Integration Guide

## âœ… Image Added Successfully

Your professional photo has been integrated into the HeroSection component and will display perfectly in Figma Make.

## ðŸš€ For GitHub Pages Deployment

**Important:** When deploying to GitHub Pages, you'll need to make one small adjustment since `figma:asset` imports don't work in standard build environments.

### Option 1: Use Public Folder (Recommended)
1. **Save your professional photo** as `/public/profile.jpg` in your project
2. **Update HeroSection.tsx** to use the public path:

```tsx
// Replace the import line:
// import profileImage from 'figma:asset/5fdc4c369ac80a2162d863fc63195ab73343fce3.png';

// With:
const profileImage = '/profile.jpg';
```

### Option 2: Use Base64 or External URL
```tsx
// Use an external URL or base64 encoded image
const profileImage = 'https://your-image-hosting-service.com/your-photo.jpg';
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Setup

Your HeroSection now displays your professional photo with:
- **Professional styling** with rounded border and gradient overlay
